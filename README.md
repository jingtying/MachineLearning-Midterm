# MachineLearning-Midterm
Midterm Assignment (Build an AI Startup)

Homework

Intro:

It's midterm season! For this assignment, you can either do it yourself or pick 1-3 partners from this course, find them in the discord channel. Together, you're going to build an MVP for an AI startup prototype. This will be a web app built using either Node.Js or Flask. We'll save mobile app development for the final. Pick an industry (i.e Finance, Medicine, Agriculture, etc.) and decide on a service you can provide to others using machine learning. Train a model on a dataset, create a web-app interface to serve it to users, and host the web app on a hosting service of your choice (i.e AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.). 

Instructions:

1. Pick a partner in the discord channel to work with you. 

2. Together, decide what your MVP startup prototype service will be. (I.e classification service for doctors, supply chain tool for retailers, etc.)

3. List out the steps needed to build the prototype, split those tasks evenly among you both. Create a shared GitHub repository where you both have commit access. This is practice in communication and shared work.

4. Your web app has 3 criteria - it should use machine learning in some way, have user login/signup functionality, and it should have a pay-to-access portion using any payment service (i.e Stripe, Braintree, paypal, etc.). You can make it a freemium model or have only paid access.

Submission 

Submit your github link to gradedhomeworkassignments@gmail.com with "Midterm" as the title of your email. The deadline is 2 weeks from assignment. Only 1 submission per team, decide who will submit it. Good luck! I'm expecting some of these projects to turn into businesses.
